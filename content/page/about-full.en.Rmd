The Big Data Institute (BDI) is an interdisciplinary research institute that focuses on the analysis of large, complex, heterogeneous data sets for research into the causes and consequences, prevention and treatment of disease.
Our coding clubâ€™s ambition is to create a fun and supportive environment where we develop programming and statistics skills together, across programming languages.
We have a many experts in working with Python, R, C++ and many more languages with vast knowledge of cloud computing and HPC and we want to replace statistics anxiety and code fear with inspiration and motivation to learn.
We hope to share our experiences with anyone in the Oxford community and hope you join us during our upcoming events!
