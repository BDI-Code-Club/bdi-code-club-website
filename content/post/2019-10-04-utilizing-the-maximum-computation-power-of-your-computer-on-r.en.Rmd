# Note

Please open your R-Studio as an administrator.

# Overview

In this tutorial, we introduce a package to use multiple cores of your system.

After this tutorial you will be able to:

*  Train a neural network model without using multicores
*  Train a neural network model without using multicores
*  Compare results


# Using R Markdown

The tutorial that follows was created using R Markdown. As an exercise in using R Markdown, here, we ask you to save your work in an R Markdown file. By the end of this session, you will have recreated the .Rmd file of this tutorial. You don't have to retype the instruction and comments. Focus only on the R code and add notes that are useful for your own understanding.

To create an R Markdown file:

* Choose **File** -> **New File** -> **R Markdown...** from RStudio menu.
* Save this file with the name **Rcode.Rmd** in your working directory. Don't change the other R Markdown options.
* From R studio menu use **Code** -> **Insert Chunk** to add boxes to save R code.

You may use the R Markdown cheat sheet [https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) to further format the output of the R Markdown file.


# R Markdown setup

This is generated by default when we create an R Markdown file. 

```{r setup}

# Change this to match the directory you have stored your scripts and data
root_directory <- "/media/sanju/B47A9D517A9D10EA/sanju-personal/rcode-clinic/rcode"

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = root_directory)

```

# Required packages

Uncomment and install a package if you didn't already.

```{r Packages}

#install.packages("caret")
library(caret)
install.packages("doMC", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
require(doMC)

## For Windows
# install.packages("doParallel")
require(doParallel)
#install.packages("e1071")
#library(e1097)
```

# Downloading Data

The data we are going to use a csv file (having gene expressions for patients) and clinical data (having response) from a breast cancer study. The data are available in folder "session-1" of this link (https://github.com/sanjaysinghrathi/Rcode-clinic/blob/master/Data.csv).

The data file  having *.csv* extension includes the gene expression data for 19 samples (patients) as well as includes clinical parameters like response referring to the samples.

```{r Welcome}

print("Welcome to Session 1")

```


# Load data 

Use this code to read the `data.csv` file into R directly from Github. Note that will **not** save the data to your computer. Alternatively, you can download the file using the link above and read it from your local directory. 
```{r data loading}

## Load data file
data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanjaysinghrathi/Rcode-clinic/master/Data.csv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

```

# Train the neural network model
 Put the timer on to check the time used by model for training.

```{r Model training}
start_time <- Sys.time()
numFolds <- trainControl(method = 'LOOCV', allowParallel = TRUE, verbose=TRUE , search = "grid")
grid <- expand.grid(size=c(seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1)),
                    decay=c(seq(from = 0.0, to = 0.9, by = 0.1)))
set.seed(567)
garbage <- capture.output(suppressWarnings(model <- train(response ~ ., data, method='nnet', trace = FALSE, preProcess = c('center', 'scale'), metric="Accuracy", trControl = numFolds, linout=FALSE, tuneGrid=grid)))
max(model$results$Accuracy, na.rm = TRUE)
training_time <- Sys.time()
print("Training time...")
training_time-start_time

```

**Question**: How much time is used by the model to train?


# Set the number of cores for DoMC

 Find the number of cores available on your computer.
 
```{r DoMC}
registerDoMC(cores=6)

## For Window users
#registerdoParallel(cores=6)
```


# Train the neural network model with maximum possible cores on computer

 Put the timer on to check the time used by model for training.

```{r Training with multicore}

start_time <- Sys.time()
numFolds <- trainControl(method = 'LOOCV', allowParallel = TRUE, verbose=TRUE , search = "grid")
grid <- expand.grid(size=c(seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1)),
                    decay=c(seq(from = 0.0, to = 0.9, by = 0.1)))
set.seed(567)
garbage <- capture.output(suppressWarnings(model <- train(response ~ ., data, method='nnet', trace = FALSE, preProcess = c('center', 'scale'), metric="Accuracy", trControl = numFolds, linout=FALSE, tuneGrid=grid)))
max(model$results$Accuracy, na.rm = TRUE)
training_time <- Sys.time()
print("Training time...")
training_time-start_time

```
**Question:** How much time is taken by the model to train with 6 cores?

# Cleaning 

Remove unwanted data. 

```{r Cleaning}
rm(numFolds)
rm(grid)
rm(model)
```

**Question:** Repeat the same to find out time required to train model with different number of cores.
