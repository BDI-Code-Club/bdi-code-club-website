      <description>Some Background Science is collaborative. Even a &amp;ldquo;solo&amp;rdquo; projects should be reproducible, meaning we should be thinking about how other researchers can benefit from our work. And we will always have at least one collaborator - our future selves. Each of us has at some point struggled to pick up a project after weeks or month (or even years) of inactivity.
Science is collaborative, and collaboration is hard. Often we aren&amp;rsquo;t trained to collaborate effectively and may be unaware of tools and practices to improve our collaborations.</description>

      <description>The Big Data Institute (BDI) is an interdisciplinary research institute that focuses on the analysis of large, complex, heterogeneous data sets for research into the causes and consequences, prevention and treatment of disease.Our coding clubâ€™s ambition is to create a fun and supportive environment where we develop programming and statistics skills together, across programming languages.We have a many experts in working with Python, R, C++ and many more languages with vast knowledge of cloud computing and HPC and we want to replace statistics anxiety and code fear with inspiration and motivation to learn.</description>
