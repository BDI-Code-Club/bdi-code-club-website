      <description>Some Background Science is collaborative. Even a &amp;ldquo;solo&amp;rdquo; projects should be reproducible, meaning we should be thinking about how other researchers can benefit from our work. And we will always have at least one collaborator - our future selves. Each of us has at some point struggled to pick up a project after weeks or month (or even years) of inactivity.
Science is collaborative, and collaboration is hard. Often we aren&amp;rsquo;t trained to collaborate effectively and may be unaware of tools and practices to improve our collaborations.</description>
